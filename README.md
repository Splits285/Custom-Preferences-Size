# Custom Preferences Size

>Original idea addon from <b>Pam Beep</b>

I added a cleaner look to the panel and added the panel settings to option bool. I also added source image so users can pick image sequence or sinle image. I Also added is showing the image texture name above its size, this is very convienent because the source path only shows a very small section. This makes it much easier to identify the used texture.

## Cust Preferences Size

This addon is a simple solution to having a bigger size preferences panel. I made this after seeing a couple posts about the preferences window being to small. Since this request has been made quite some while back and nothing is updated i searched for a solution. Seeing this simple code on Developer Blender by Pan Beed, i decided to make simple add-on out if it for ease of use.
